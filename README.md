## 1. <a name="_toc1">Introduction</a>

The Workflow Templates Extension for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central enhances the approval processes by introducing a set of customised workflow templates designed to address specific business scenarios. This extension builds upon the standard Business Central workflow functionality, providing businesses with more options to tailor workflows to their operational needs.

The extension includes the following templates:

- G/L Budget Approval Workflow
- General Journal Batch Approval Workflow (enhancement)
- Item Journal Approval Workflow
- Physical Inventory Order Approval Workflow
- Sales Price Margin Approval Workflow

By extending the capabilities of Business Central, this app helps organisations implement workflows that align with their internal processes, providing flexibility and consistency in managing approvals.

This document outlines the features and functionality of each workflow template, along with detailed information on configuration and usage. It serves as a resource for businesses looking to enhance their workflow management within the Business Central environment.
